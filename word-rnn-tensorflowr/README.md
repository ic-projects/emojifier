# word-rnn-tensorflow
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow)

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for word-level language models in Python using TensorFlow.

Mostly reused code from https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow which was inspired from Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tinyshakespeare corpus, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

To sample from a trained model"
```bash
python sample.py
```

# Sample output
