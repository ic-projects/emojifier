#### EMOJIFIER

## Inspiration
meme 🐸 is 🐸 love ❤🤔💌💘, meme 🐸❤ is 🐸 life 👪

## What it does
Using a combination of word embeddings and lstms and neural networks, 📵 the 1⃣ program predicts which emoji 📱🖱 is useful 🔧 based on 🛬 sentence 🚟 context.

## How we built it
We 🚯🙄 collected data 💁 from reddit 🐸 and twitter and using tensorflow we 🚯🙄 trained 🚋 the 1⃣ different 🚼 models such as 🇿🇦 character level 🎛 lstm, word level 🎛 lstm and fixed input neural network and also using googles 👽 word2vector for ⏺🎙 word embeddings. 
tying the 1⃣ front 🚅 end 🔙💆 and back 🔜◀↩👇 end 🔙💆 was very 🇿🇦 hard 🙅 we 🚯🙄 started out ✌🔜🆙↕ with using ruby 💎 on 🛬 rails 🚈🚋 to start 🔙 a background python 🐊🐆🐇🐍 process which was used for ⏺🎙 the 1⃣ emoji 📱🖱 prediction but 🇿🇦🚯 we 🚯🙄 could 🚯 not 🚯‼ find 🙈👀 a way 🌌  to append to the 1⃣ standard input stream for ⏺🎙 the 1⃣ process so 🇿🇦🚯 instead 🍶 we 🚯🙄 used nodejs to run 🎽🏃 in 🌉 parallel with a python 🐊🐆🐇🐍 server 💻🖨 which listened 👂 for ⏺🎙 post 🏣🏤🚩 requests from the 1⃣ nodejs client and then 🔜🔃 using twmoji to beautifully 😄 render the 1⃣ final 🌛🌓 emojis.

## Challenges we ran into
Describing emojis 📱🖱 as 🇿🇦 a single 🔂1⃣ word. 🔂 problems with training 🚋 data 💁 on 🛬 tensorflow.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a finished 🏁 product in our first ichack.

## What we learned
Learning 🏫 different 🚼 programming 📺 languages.more about machine 🎰⌨ learning 🎰 and using real ‼ world 🏔🌐🌏🌍 data 🏔💁.

## What's next for EM😜JI🔥
Turning ⤵ text 📜 into 🔜✌ raw 🆕 memes 🐸
